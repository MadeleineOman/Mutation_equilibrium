# **description of the directory where we calculate the average mutability of the genomic coding and intergenci seqeunces**

1. get the coding and intergenic seqeunces 
- done in the notebook in the gettingCdsIntergenic folder 
    
2. caclulate and compare mutability for the cds and intergenic classes 
- done in the "1_cdsIntergenicMutCalcCompare.ipynb" notebook
- the results are plotted in the 1.1 R notebook and the plot is saved in "plots/"

### **we also used this work to calculate the equilibrium value of human itnegrenic seqeunce and compare that to the equilibrium found in our work**
- this was done in the 2_outOfEquilibriumCalculations.ipynb notebook
- these results were not included in the MS, but were requested in a review

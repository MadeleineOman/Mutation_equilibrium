# **description of the notebook and data in this directory**

0. donwloading and 

1. first draft of the mutability (triplet) model 
--> using a random sample of triplets to divide the # mutations and generate mutability for each triplet. 

2. extending the model to genome wide 
--> using all the triplets in the genome to divide # mutations 

3. generating mutability for 5-mers 

4. creating seperate models for the coding and noncoding regions 


# **description of the folders**

other_species_mutability_model/ 
--> creating the models for the model species used for the comparison in the firts resutls text (mainly comparing the range of mutability seen across different species)

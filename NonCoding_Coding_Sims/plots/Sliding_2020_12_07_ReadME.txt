I feel it necessary to include the fact that the exon / intron horizontal mean etdferr is from the stderr acors trials, not between exons. 
--> thats why the exon stderr isnt crazy: because the mean exon mutability was so miliar b/t sims. 
--> same applies for the introns 

--> also note that all exons are weights the same in the mean (no accounting for length)

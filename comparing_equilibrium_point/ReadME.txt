# **description of the comparing equilibrium point simulations**
- namely, here we compared human intergenic and ranom sequence (where random seq could have uniform triplet freqs, or triplet freqs that macth the human genome)

step 1: creating the dna an dsimulating 
- human intergenic = 1_intergenicSim.ipynb
- random with triplet freq that mirror that of the human genome = 2_tripFreqRepSim.ipynb
- random with unfirom triplet freqs = 3_truerandom.ipynb

step2: 
- wrangle and plot the simulations result all together (all 3 seqeunce classes)
